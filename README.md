Welcome to the Online Quizzes System! This system allows trainers to create quizzes and assign them to students. Students can then attempt the quizzes within a 
specified duration. The quizzes will be corrected by the trainer, and the grades will be published to the students, along with their pass/fail status and additional 
performance indicators.

**Features:**
User Registration: Students and trainers can register in the system with their unique credentials.
Quiz Creation: Trainers can create quizzes by adding questions and defining the duration for each quiz.
Quiz Assignment: Trainers can assign quizzes to individual students or groups of students.
Quiz Attempt: Students can attempt assigned quizzes within the specified duration.
Quiz Correction: Trainers can review and correct the submitted quizzes.
Grading: Trainers can assign grades to students based on their quiz performance.
Performance Indicators: Students receive additional indicators, such as pass/fail status, excellent, or very good, based on their grades.
Notifications: Students and trainers receive notifications regarding quiz assignments, quiz completion, and grade publication.
